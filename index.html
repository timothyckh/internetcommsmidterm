        <h2>What Is Political Polarisation?</h2>
        <p><b>Political polarisation</b> refers to the division of a society or political system into two or more opposing ideological camps, often characterized by deep-seated differences in values, beliefs, and policy preferences. Polarisation can occur on a variety of issues, including social, economic, and cultural ones, and it can be fuelled by a plethora of factors, such as media exposure, political messaging, and socio-economic conditions. 

            <br><br>One of the key features of political polarisation is the tendency of individuals and groups to become more entrenched in their political positions and are less willing to compromise or engage in constructive dialogue with those who hold opposing views, especially if they have been conditioned over a period of time and as a result have developed prejudices. This can lead to a breakdown in civil discourse and increased hostility between different segments of society, which can resultantly worsen social divisions and make it increasingly difficult to identify common ground on policy issues.</br></br></p>

        <h2>The Political Compass</h2>
        <p>Ideological camps may sit anywhere across the political spectrum, defined by the extent of governmental interventionism in social and economic issues. The following is a diagram of the Political Compass, which will help this report to navigate the different ideological standpoints as well as their inherent goals.</p>

        <h3>ECONOMIC LEFT-WING</h3>
        <br>
            <p>A party that aligns itself with the <u>economic left</u> believes in more governmental intervention in the market. This would typically mean progression taxation on individuals and corporations to fund social services such as education, healthcare and more. One example of a left-wing economic policy is the implementation of a progressive tax system. Under a progressive tax system, those with higher incomes are taxed at a higher rate than those with lower incomes. The goal of this policy is to redistribute wealth and reduce income inequality. Overall, the goal of such a party would be to achieve greater social and economic equality through the redistribution of wealth, at the expense of economically unfriendly policies. </p>
        </br>

        <h3>ECONOMIC RIGHT-WING</h3>
        <br>
            <p>A party that aligns itself with the <u>economic right</u> believes in less governmental intervention in the market. With policies such as deregulation, tax cuts, and privatisation of public services, they believe that a freer market would bring greater economic growth. However, this might come at the cost of greater social and economic inequality. One example of a right-wing economic policy is supply-side economics, also known as "trickle-down" economics. This theory advocates for policies that promote economic growth and job creation by cutting taxes and regulations on businesses, which it is argued will encourage investment, production, and consumption. Overall, the goal of this ideology is to encourage and stimulate economic growth and market conditions. </p>
        </br>

        <h3>SOCIAL LIBERTARIAN</h3>
        <br>
            <p>A party that aligns itself with <u>libertarianism</u> would allow for greater social liberties. This would mean passing policies that protect individual privacy and civil liberties such as freedom of speech and freedom of religion. By doing so, they want to create a society that is free and equal, where individuals can pursue their interests and potential without being hindered systemically. One example of a libertarian policy is the legalisation of marijuana and other recreational drugs. Libertarians generally believe that individuals should have the freedom to make their own choices, even if those choices are harmful to themselves. Thus, adoption of this ideology may come at the expense of moral erosion.</p>
        </br>

        <h3>SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE</h3>
        <br>
            <p>A party that aligns itself with <u>conservative</u> would focus on the preservation of traditional values and institutions. This would mean passing policies that protect the nuclear family, as well as religious and cultural beliefs and traditions. Some authoritarian governments have implemented policies to reduce crime and improve public safety. For example, Singapore has strict laws and harsh penalties for crimes such as drug trafficking, which has led to low crime rates and a relatively safe society. However, these policies have also been criticised for their lack of due process and human rights violations. Ultimately, the goal is to maintain a stable and cohesive society by regulating social behaviours.  </p>

        <h3>NO IDEOLOGY IS INHERENTLY RIGHT OR WRONG.</h3>

        <br>
            <p>After all, ideologies are merely the cumulation of the wishes of society itself. However, due to each ideologies conflicting goals, political parties often pit themselves against the other side in order to push their interests and agendas through. In America, the Democrats are presented as left-economically and libertarian leaning. Republicans are right-wing economically, as well as authoritarian. Thus, their social and economic interests oppose each other intensely, now more than ever. Interestingly, when comparing their policies to other governments around the world, both Democrats and Republicans are right winged economically. For example, the Affordable Care Act is seen as a liberal initiative, but its efforts to support it and the provision of the scheme are shallow compared to true universal healthcare systems. Nonetheless, tensions still exist because of the unquestionable gap in stance. Here is an infographic that gives a general overview of the two political stances.  </p>

            <h3>HISTORY OF POLITICAL POLARISATION AND ITS IMPACT IN AMERICA</h3>
            <br>
                <p>While the polarisation between Democrats and Republicans began in the 1970s as a result of the civil rights movement, the rift seems to have widened because of the advent of social media. On social media platforms, users may enter groups and chat with individuals who share similar views, reinforcing inherent beliefs. This narrows interactions with others who may have differing viewpoints, making it difficult to learn how to listen and empathise with others. This is especially so when new users are bullied and harassed online for sharing differing views, disincentivizing others from sharing their differing ideas. Content algorithms feed users media that aligns with their own political beliefs, trapping users in filter bubbles by feeding into their confirmation bias. One example of how Facebook's filter bubbles have led to political polarisation can be seen in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Facebook's algorithms have been engineered to show users content that they are likely to engage with, based on their previous activity on the site. This means that if a user clicks on articles or posts that align with a particular political ideology, Facebook is more likely to show them similar content in the future. During the 2016 election, this algorithmic design led to the creation of echo chambers and filter bubbles, where users were only exposed to content that reinforced their pre-existing beliefs. This meant that users who leaned left were more likely to see content that was critical of Donald Trump, while users who leaned right were more likely to see content that was critical of Hillary Clinton. As a result, both sides became more entrenched in their beliefs, less willing to engage in civil dialogue.

            </br>
                <p>This is made worse when the recommended content contains false information that demonises individuals and politicians on the other end of the spectrum, which is often the case. The unfortunate cause of this is due to the effectiveness of outrage media, which tends to proliferate more successfully. Politicians rile the emotions of voters up by conjuring outrage at the actions or policies being proposed by the other side on social media in order to motivate individuals to vote. Another example of this is when Fox News decided to air stories about Dominican Voting Systems, purposefully telling viewers that there was a potential fabrication of votes for Biden during the 2020 Presidential Election in order to attract viewers. In reality, the network knew that the story was false. However, the story nonetheless enraged Trump voters, whose mistrust in the government was further exacerbated by Trump himself on social media to the point that they eventually stormed the Capitol Building on 6 Jan 2021.
                The storming of the Capitol can be seen as a manifestation of political polarisation, with some Trump supporters feeling that their political views were not being adequately represented or acknowledged by the government. The event also highlighted the deep divisions in American society, with different groups having vastly different perceptions of reality and engaging in increasingly aggressive and confrontational behaviour.
            
                The tribalism fuelled by politicians has also limited their inability to work with each other for fear of backlash from their voter base which has been built up through the demonisation of politicians of other parties. Should they compromise and support bills from each other, it would look like a betrayal to voters, like they are working with the enemy. This ‘us vs them’ mentality that worked to attract voters now hinders the progress of American policy making.

        <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
        <br>
            <p>Political polarisation has worsened due to selective exposure and social media recommendations have worsened to the point of violence and killings. We have collectively developed the inability, or unwillingness of society to hear, understand, and empathise with each other across the social and political spectrum. We have been conditioned, by politicians, media outlets, even each other, to think of the other side as enemies. Now more than ever, media literacy has become increasingly important for individuals to be able to distinguish between reliable and unreliable sources of information. By teaching media literacy skills in schools, we can become more discerning consumers of information and less likely to be swayed by false or misleading narratives. We must also foster constructive dialogue by creating safe spaces where people can engage in constructive dialogue, even if they disagree with one another. Finally, we must work to develop empathy. By cultivating empathy, we can become more understanding of different perspectives and less likely to view those with differing beliefs as enemies.
            <br><br>At the end of the day, we are all still human beings. We breathe the same air, walk the same earth, and feel the same emotions. Though we have different priorities, different interests, we must work to understand and hear each other, to empathise with the concerns of others. With kindness and compromise, we will bridge the divides between ourselves to make a better tomorrow together. </br></br></p>
